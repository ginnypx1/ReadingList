# Reading List

"Reading List" is an app developed to practice Core Data.

"Reading List" allows the user to create and store a list of books to read.

## Install

To check out this simple reading list app:

1. Clone or download my repository:
` $ https://github.com/ginnypx1/ReadingList.git `

2. Enter the "Reading List" directory:
` $ cd /ReadingList-master/ `

3. Open "Reading List" in XCode:
` $ open ReadingList.xcodeproj `

## Instructions

Launch the app and create your first book to save by tapping the **+** button in the upper-right hand corner.

## Technical Information

The app data is persisted using Core Data.

## Additional Features

This app would be really cool as a tabbed app with tabs for saving movies, tv and books the user would like to remember to consume.

Additional features I am currently working on include:
- the edit button title needs to change to done when deleting a book title
- add a nice screen for any empty table prompting the user to add a book title
